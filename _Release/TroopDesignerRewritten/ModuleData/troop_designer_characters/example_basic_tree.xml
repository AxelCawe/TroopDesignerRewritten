	<!--
		This xml document is an example of troop tree with informations about the used attributes.
		Be sure to test your characters often, as an error in the xml will result in your mod not being able to start, 
		and it will be harder to debug a huge amount of modifications than just a unit or two.
		
		If you want to create your own characters within this mod, create an additional file structured like this one in the 'troop_designer_characters' folder (not recommanded as you will have a dependency to this mod).
		If you want to add characters in your own mod, take a look at the SubModule.xml (recommended).
		
		For more examples, check 'Mount & Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\SandBoxCore\ModuleData\spnpccharacters.xml'

			The equipments this unit will use
			To have an item slot optional, have an equipment roster without it (like the 'Cape' slot in the example below, only present in the second equipment roster)
			
			Randomization:
			- the randomization will be done on each equipment roster element, this is not an equipment roster pick
			- this means that in the following example, a unit could have a 'seax' (roster 1) with a 'tied_cloth_tunic' (roster 2)
			- this make it difficult to have a unit having different ranged weapon options (cause the weapons and quivers will be randomly distributed, which mean a unit can end up with a bow + bolts or crossbow + arrows) (see: 'example_bad_practice.xml')
			- try having specialized unit to prevent such issues
			
			The available slots are:
			- Item0
			- Item1
			- Item2
			- Item3
			- Item4
			- Head
			- Cape
			- Body
			- Gloves
			- Leg
			- Horse
			- HorseHarness
			
			If you want your unit to hold a banner, use the id "campaign_banner_small" with the "Item4"  slot
